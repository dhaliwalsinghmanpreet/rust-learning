crates,   -----------------------A tree of modules that produces a library or executable,packages of code are referred to as crates,Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files.The project we’ve been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. The rand crate is a library crate, which contains code intended to be used in other programs.
Cargo,------------------------- expects your source files to live inside the src directory.

prelude,--------------------- Rust comes with a variety of things in its standard library. However, if you had to manually import every single thing that you used, it would be very verbose. But importing a lot of things that a program never uses isn’t good either. A balance needs to be struck.The prelude is the list of things that Rust automatically imports into every Rust program.Preludes can be seen as a pattern to make using multiple types more convenient. As such, you’ll find other preludes in the standard library, such as std::io::prelude. Various libraries in the Rust ecosystem may also define their own preludes.The difference between ‘the prelude’ and these other preludes is that they are not automatically use’d, and must be imported manually. This is still easier than importing all of their constituent components.

String::new, a function that returns a new instance of a String.String is a string type provided by the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.The :: syntax in the ::new line indicates that new is an associated function of the String type. An associated function is implemented on a type, in this case String, rather than on a particular instance of a String. Some languages call this a static method.

like variables, references are immutable by default

Rust has a number of types named Result in its standard library: a generic Result as well as specific versions for submodules, such as io::Result.The Result types are enumerations, often referred to as enums. An enumeration is a type that can have a fixed set of values, and those values are called the enum’s variants.

For Result, the variants are Ok or Err. The Ok variant indicates the operation was successful, and inside Ok is the successfully generated value. The Err variant means the operation failed, and Err contains information about how or why the operation failed.The purpose of these Result types is to encode error-handling information. Values of the Result type, like values of any type, have methods defined on them. An instance of io::Result has an expect method that you can call. If this instance of io::Result is an Err value, expect will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to expect. If the read_line method returns an Err, it would likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system. If this instance of io::Result is an Ok value, expect will take the return value that Ok is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it.


Cargo understands Semantic Versioning (sometimes called SemVer), which is a standard for writing version numbers. The number 0.8.3 is actually shorthand for ^0.8.3, which means any version that is at least 0.8.3 but below 0.9.0. Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version 0.8.3, and this specification ensures you'll get the latest patch release that will still compile with the code in this chapter. Any version 0.9.0 or greater is not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples use.

https://crates.io/   Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything from the registry.When you do want to update a crate, Cargo provides another command, update, which will ignore the Cargo.lock file and figure out all the latest versions that fit your specifications in Cargo.toml. If that works, Cargo will write those versions to the Cargo.lock file.But by default, Cargo will only look for versions greater than 0.8.3 and less than 0.9.0. If the rand crate has released two new versions, 0.8.4 and 0.9.0, you would see the following if you ran cargo update:
$ cargo update
    Updating crates.io index
    Updating rand v0.8.3 -> v0.8.4
	
	Rust has a strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote let mut guess = String::new(), Rust was able to infer that guess should be a String and didn’t make us write the type. The secret_number, on the other hand, is a number type. A few number types can have a value between 1 and 100: i32, a 32-bit number; u32, an unsigned 32-bit number; i64, a 64-bit number; as well as others. Rust defaults to an i32, which is the type of secret_number unless you add type information elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type.
	
	Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of guess with a new one. This feature is often used in situations in which you want to convert a value from one type to another type.Shadowing lets us reuse the guess variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as guess_str and guess for example.
	let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
	The colon (:) after guess tells Rust we’ll annotate the variable’s type. Rust has a few built-in number types; the u32 seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It’s a good default choice for a small positive number.
	
	The loop keyword creates an infinite loop.
	
	Err(_) . The underscore, _, is a catchall value; in this example, we’re saying we want to match all Err values, no matter what information they have inside them.
	
	 const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000; underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability
	 few differences between constants and variables.First, you aren’t allowed to use mut with constants. Constants aren’t just immutable by default—they’re always immutable.You declare constants using the const keyword instead of the let keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated. Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about. constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.
	 
	 Shadowing :- you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable’s value is what appears when the variable is used. We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the use of the let keyword.Shadowing is different from marking a variable as mut, because we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the let keyword. By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, but we really want to store that input as a number
	 let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();


Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.We’ll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.Keep in mind that Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

The isize and usize types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.
Note that all number literals except the byte literal allow a type suffix, such as 57u8, and _ as a visual separator, such as 1_000.
If you’re unsure, Rust’s defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to i32: this type is generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which you’d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.

When you’re compiling in release mode with the --release flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs two’s complement wrapping. In short, values greater than the maximum value the type can hold “wrap around” to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of a u8, 256 becomes 0, 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won’t panic, but the variable will have a value that probably isn’t what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow’s wrapping behavior is considered an error.
Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add
Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods
Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods
Saturate at the value's minimum or maximum values with saturating_* methods

Rust’s floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision.Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.


Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool. 

Rust’s char type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type.Rust’s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive.

Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type.Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same.
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup; //This is called destructuring, because it breaks the single tuple into three parts. 

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. 
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;//As with most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}

Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Arrays in Rust are different from arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length.Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isn’t as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size. 
You would write an array’s type by using square brackets, and within the brackets include the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array.
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
if you want to create an array that contains the same value for each element, you can specify the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets.
let a = [3; 5];
When you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length, Rust will panic. This is the first example of Rust’s safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing. 


one of the most important functions in the language: the main function, which is the entry point of many programs.Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words. 
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
Function definitions in Rust start with fn and have a set of parentheses after the function name. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.Functions can also be defined to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values are called arguments, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words parameter and argument interchangeably for either the variables in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what you mean.When you want a function to have multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas.
Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the let keyword is a statement. Function definitions are also statements.Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a let statement to another variable.
let x = (let y = 6);
The let y = 6 statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for x to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such as C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those languages, you can write x = y = 6 and have both x and y have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust.
Consider a simple math operation, such as 5 + 6, which is an expression that evaluates to the value 11. Expressions can be part of statements:
The block that we use to create new scopes, {}, is an expression,
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
Note the x + 1 line without a semicolon at the end, which is unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so far
Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement
In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function.
 In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the return keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly. 


Rust has three kinds of loops: loop, while, and for. 
The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop
Rust provides another, more reliable way to break out of a loop. You can place the break keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop executing the loop. 
One of the uses of a loop is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has completed its job. However, you might need to pass the result of that operation to the rest of your code. To do this, you can add the value you want returned after the break expression you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
The safety and conciseness of for loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code a certain number of times,


Rust’s central feature is ownership. Although the feature is straightforward to explain, it has deep implications for the rest of the language.Some languages have garbage collection that constantly looks for no longer used memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. None of the ownership features slow down your program while it’s running.In many programming languages, you don’t have to think about the stack and the heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap has more of an effect on how the language behaves and why you have to make certain decisions. Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory that are available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as last in, first out.All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead. The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location. This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes abbreviated as just allocating. Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating. Because the pointer is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack.Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the stack and the heap very often, but knowing that managing heap data is why ownership exists can help explain why it works the way it does.
Ownership Rules:-
Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
There can only be one owner at a time.
When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called drop, and it’s where the author of String can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls drop automatically at the closing curly bracket.

Ways Variables and Data Interact: Move
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
To ensure memory safety, there’s one more detail to what happens in this situation in Rust. Instead of trying to copy the allocated memory, Rust considers s1 to no longer be valid and, therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when s1 goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use s1 after s2 is created; it won’t work.If you’ve heard the terms shallow copy and deep copy while working with other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a shallow copy, it’s known as a move.Rust will never automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any automatic copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance. If we do want to deeply copy the heap data of the String, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called clone.types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack.
Rust has a special annotation called the Copy trait that we can place on types like integers that are stored on the stack (we’ll talk more about traits in Chapter 10). If a type implements the Copy trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. Rust won’t let us annotate a type with the Copy trait if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the Drop trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the Copy annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the Copy annotation to your type to implement the trait, see “Derivable Traits” in Appendix C.any group of simple scalar values can implement Copy, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement Copy. Here are some of the types that implement Copy:
All the integer types, such as u32
The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
All the floating point types, such as f64.
The character type, char.
Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.

Ownership and Functions
The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to those for assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.
Returning values can also transfer ownership.The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by drop unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable.

References and Borrowing
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
The opposite of referencing by using & is dereferencing, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, *. We’ll see some uses of the dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in Chapter 15.We call having references as function parameters borrowing. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back.So what happens if we try to modify something we’re borrowing? Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We’re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.But mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. We also cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one.Users of an immutable reference don’t expect the values to suddenly change out from under them! However, multiple immutable references are okay because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else’s reading of the data.

Dangling References
In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a dangling pointer, a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

The Rules of References
At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
References must always be valid


The Slice Type
Another data type that does not have ownership is the slice. Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.
String Slices
A string slice is a reference to part of a String, and it looks like this:
let s = String::from("hello world");
let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];
This is similar to taking a reference to the whole String but with the extra [0..5] bit. Rather than a reference to the entire String, it’s a reference to a portion of the String.We can create slices using a range within brackets by specifying [starting_index..ending_index], where starting_index is the first position in the slice and ending_index is one more than the last position in the slice. Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice, which corresponds to ending_index minus starting_index. So in the case of let world = &s[6..11];, world would be a slice that contains a pointer to the 7th byte (counting from 1) of s with a length value of 5.
With Rust’s .. range syntax, if you want to start at the first index (zero), you can drop the value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:
let s = String::from("hello");
let slice = &s[0..2];
let slice = &s[..2];
By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the String, you can drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:
let s = String::from("hello");
let len = s.len();
let slice = &s[3..len];
let slice = &s[3..];
You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So these are equal:
let s = String::from("hello");
let len = s.len();
let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];

String Literals Are Slices
Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:
let s = "Hello, world!";

String Slices as Parameters
1. fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
2. improved case fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly. If we have a String, we can pass a slice of the entire String. Defining a function to take a string slice instead of a reference to a String makes our API more general and useful without losing any functionality:

Other Slices
String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a more general slice type, too. Consider this array:
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
Just as we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer to part of an array. We’d do so like this:
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[1..3];
This slice has the type &[i32]. It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other collections. We’ll discuss these collections in detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.

Using Structs to Structure Related Data
A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a struct is like an object’s data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples with structs, demonstrate how to use structs, and discuss how to define methods and associated functions to specify behavior associated with a struct’s data. Structs and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile time type checking.
Structs are similar to tuples, which were discussed in Chapter 3. Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. As a result of these names, structs are more flexible than tuples: you don’t have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
	
let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");	
Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable. As with any expression, we can construct a new instance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to implicitly return that new instance.
Using the Field Init Shorthand when Variables and Fields Have the Same Name
Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same in Listing 5-4, we can use the field init shorthand syntax to rewrite build_user so that it behaves exactly the same but doesn’t have the repetition of email and username.
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
	User {
		email,
		username,
		active: true,
		sign_in_count: 1,
	}
}
Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax
let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
        active: user1.active,
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as shown in Listing 5-7. The syntax .. specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.
	let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
        ..user1
    };

Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types
You can also define structs that look similar to tuples, called tuple structs. Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple be a different type from other tuples, and naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.	To define a tuple struct, start with the struct keyword and the struct name followed by the types in the tuple.
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);

Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields
You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called unit-like structs because they behave similarly to (), the unit type. Unit-like structs can be useful in situations in which you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself. We’ll discuss traits in Chapter 10.

Ownership of Struct Data
In the User struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned String type rather than the &str string slice type. This is a deliberate choice because we want instances of this struct to own all of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.
It’s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of lifetimes, a Rust feature that we’ll discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like this, which won’t work:
struct User {
    username: &str,
    email: &str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: "someone@example.com",
        username: "someusername123",
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}

Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits
It’d be nice to be able to print an instance of Rectangle while we’re debugging our program and see the values for all its fields. 
The println! macro call will now look like println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);. Putting the specifier :? inside the curly brackets tells println! we want to use an output format called Debug. The Debug trait enables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so we can see its value while we’re debugging our code.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}
When we have larger structs, it’s useful to have output that’s a bit easier to read; in those cases, we can use {:#?} instead of {:?} in the println! string.
Rust has provided a number of traits for us to use with the derive annotation that can add useful behavior to our custom types. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in Appendix C. We’ll cover how to implement these traits with custom behavior as well as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10.

Method Syntax
Methods are similar to functions: they’re declared with the fn keyword and their name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code that is run when they’re called from somewhere else. However, methods are different from functions in that they’re defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, which we cover in Chapters 6 and 17, respectively), and their first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self, str: String) -> u32 {
        println!("{}", str);
        self.width * self.height
    }
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
	//Associated method ( same as static method in java)
    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}
impl Rectangle {
    fn print_object(&self) {
        println!("{:#?}", self);
    }
}
Associated Functions
Another useful feature of impl blocks is that we’re allowed to define functions within impl blocks that don’t take self as a parameter. These are called associated functions because they’re associated with the struct. They’re still functions, not methods, because they don’t have an instance of the struct to work with. You’ve already used the String::from associated function.
Associated functions are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct. For example, we could provide an associated function that would have one dimension parameter and use that as both width and height, thus making it easier to create a square Rectangle rather than having to specify the same value twice:
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}
To call this associated function, we use the :: syntax with the struct name; let sq = Rectangle::square(3); is an example. This function is namespaced by the struct: the :: syntax is used for both associated functions and namespaces created by modules.

Enums and Pattern Matching
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. First, we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called Option, which expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. hen we’ll look at how pattern matching in the match expression makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the if let construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to you to handle enums in your code.
Rust’s enums are most similar to algebraic data types in functional languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }

    struct IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind,
        address: String,
    }

    let home = IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
        address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
    };

    let loopback = IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
        address: String::from("::1"),
    };
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	enum IpAddr {
        V4(String),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	enum IpAddr {
        V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}

---------------------------------------------------------------
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
impl Message {
        fn call(&self) {
            // method body would be defined here
        }
    }

    let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
    m.call();
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Option Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
let some_number = Some(5);
let some_string = Some("a string");
let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;

The match Control Flow Operator
Rust has an extremely powerful control flow operator called match that allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 18 covers all the different kinds of patterns and what they do. The power of match comes from the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are handled.
Think of a match expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: coins slide down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go through each pattern in a match, and at the first pattern the value “fits,” the value falls into the associated code block to be used during execution.
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}
fn which_coin(coin: &Coins) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coins::Penny => { 1 }
        Coins::Nickel => 5,
        Coins::Dime => {10},
        Coins::Quarter => 25
    }
}

Patterns that Bind to Values
Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern. This is how we can extract values out of enum variants.
#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        }
    }
}

Matching with Option<T>
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            None => None,
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }
    let five = Some(5);
    let six = plus_one(five);
    let none = plus_one(None);
	
	
Matches Are Exhaustive
   fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }
We didn’t handle the None case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this error:	
Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are exhaustive: we must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of Option<T>, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the None case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might have null.

The _ Placeholder
Rust also has a pattern we can use when we don’t want to list all possible values. For example, a u8 can have valid values of 0 through 255. If we only care about the values 1, 3, 5, and 7, we don’t want to have to list out 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 all the way up to 255. Fortunately, we don’t have to: we can use the special pattern _ instead:
let some_u8_value = 0u8;
    match some_u8_value {
        1 => println!("one"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        5 => println!("five"),
        7 => println!("seven"),
        _ => (),
    }
The _ pattern will match any value. By putting it after our other arms, the _ will match all the possible cases that aren’t specified before it. The () is just the unit value, so nothing will happen in the _ case. As a result, we can say that we want to do nothing for all the possible values that we don’t list before the _ placeholder.
However, the match expression can be a bit wordy in a situation in which we care about only one of the cases. For this situation, Rust provides if let.

Concise Control Flow with if let
The if let syntax lets you combine if and let into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.
let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
    match some_u8_value {
        Some(3) => println!("three"),
        _ => (),
    }
We want to do something with the Some(3) match but do nothing with any other Some<u8> value or the None value. To satisfy the match expression, we have to add _ => () after processing just one variant, which is a lot of boilerplate code to add.
Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using if let.
let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
    if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
        println!("three");
    }	
The syntax if let takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign. It works the same way as a match, where the expression is given to the match and the pattern is its first arm.	Using if let means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code. However, you lose the exhaustive checking that match enforces. Choosing between match and if let depends on what you’re doing in your particular situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.In other words, you can think of if let as syntax sugar for a match that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.
We can include an else with an if let. The block of code that goes with the else is the same as the block of code that would go with the _ case in the match expression that is equivalent to the if let and else.
let mut count = 0;
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
    } else {
        count += 1;
    }
	

Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules
As a project grows, you can organize code by splitting it into multiple modules and then multiple files. A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into separate crates that become external dependencies. 
A related concept is scope: the nested context in which code is written has a set of names that are defined as “in scope.” When reading, writing, and compiling code, programmers and compilers need to know whether a particular name at a particular spot refers to a variable, function, struct, enum, module, constant, or other item and what that item means. You can create scopes and change which names are in or out of scope. You can’t have two items with the same name in the same scope; tools are available to resolve name conflicts.
Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the module system, include:
Packages: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
Crates: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
Modules and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

Packages and Crates
A crate is a binary or library. The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate .A package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. 
A package contains a Cargo.toml file that describes how to build those crates.Several rules determine what a package can contain. A package must contain zero or one library crates, and no more. It can contain as many binary crates as you’d like, but it must contain at least one crate (either library or binary).
we enter the command cargo new
$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project
Cargo.toml
src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs
When we entered the command, Cargo created a Cargo.toml file, giving us a package. Looking at the contents of Cargo.toml, there’s no mention of src/main.rs because Cargo follows a convention that src/main.rs is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package directory contains src/lib.rs, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package, and src/lib.rs is its crate root. Cargo passes the crate root files to rustc to build the library or binary.
Here, we have a package that only contains src/main.rs, meaning it only contains a binary crate named my-project. If a package contains src/main.rs and src/lib.rs, it has two crates: a library and a binary, both with the same name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the src/bin directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.A crate will group related functionality together in a scope so the functionality is easy to share between multiple projects.Keeping a crate’s functionality in its own scope clarifies whether particular functionality is defined in our crate or the rand crate and prevents potential conflicts. For example, the rand crate provides a trait named Rng. We can also define a struct named Rng in our own crate. Because a crate’s functionality is namespaced in its own scope, when we add rand as a dependency, the compiler isn’t confused about what the name Rng refers to. In our crate, it refers to the struct Rng that we defined. We would access the Rng trait from the rand crate as rand::Rng.

Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy
In this section, we’ll talk about modules and other parts of the module system, namely paths that allow you to name items; the use keyword that brings a path into scope; and the pub keyword to make items public. We’ll also discuss the as keyword, external packages, and the glob operator.
Modules let us organize code within a crate into groups for readability and easy reuse. Modules also control the privacy of items, which is whether an item can be used by outside code (public) or is an internal implementation detail and not available for outside use (private).
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
We define a module by starting with the mod keyword and then specify the name of the module (in this case, front_of_house) and place curly brackets around the body of the module. Inside modules, we can have other modules, as in this case with the modules hosting and serving. Modules can also hold definitions for other items, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, 
By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why they’re related. Programmers using this code would have an easier time finding the definitions they wanted to use because they could navigate the code based on the groups rather than having to read through all the definitions. Programmers adding new functionality to this code would know where to place the code to keep the program organized.
Earlier, we mentioned that src/main.rs and src/lib.rs are called crate roots. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two files form a module named crate at the root of the crate’s module structure, known as the module tree.
crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside one another (for example, hosting nests inside front_of_house). The tree also shows that some modules are siblings to each other, meaning they’re defined in the same module (hosting and serving are defined within front_of_house). To continue the family metaphor, if module A is contained inside module B, we say that module A is the child of module B and that module B is the parent of module A. Notice that the entire module tree is rooted under the implicit module named crate.
The module tree might remind you of the filesystem’s directory tree on your computer; this is a very apt comparison! Just like directories in a filesystem, you use modules to organize your code. And just like files in a directory, we need a way to find our modules.


Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree
To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. If we want to call a function, we need to know its path.
A path can take two forms:
An absolute path starts from a crate root by using a crate name or a literal crate.
A relative path starts from the current module and uses self, super, or an identifier in the current module.
